For Django Dash 2010, @pydanny and @audreyr (the "Scared of Rabbits" team) created Django Packages and have been working on it since then, turning it into the OpenComparison framework.

They are joined by a host of core developers and contributors.  See http://opencomparison.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributors.html
