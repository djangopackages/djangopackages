## Quickstart

For detailed installation instructions, consult the [docs](https://docs.djangopackages.org/en/latest/install).

To download, install and start the local server for development, simply run:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:djangopackages/djangopackages.git
cd djangopackages
cp .env.local.example .env.local
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and start hacking!

If you are running into conflicting port issues, we have an override file which re-maps Django (port: 18000) and Postgres (port: 45432). To activate it, simply run:

```shell
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
````

To run tests, run:

```shell
docker-compose run django pytest
```
