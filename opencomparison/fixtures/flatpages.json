Ever want to know which is the most popular or well supported Django \r\n        blog, content management system, or api tool? Django Packages solves that problem for you!\r\n    </p> \r\n    \r\n    <h2>What is a Python?</h2> \r\n    \r\n    <p>A Django package is anything that is involved in the Django ecosphere that can be stored on a \r\n        repository such as Github or Bitbucket.
