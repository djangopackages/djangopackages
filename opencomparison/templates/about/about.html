    <h1>About Django Packages</h1>
    
    <p>Django Packages solves the problem in the Django community of being able to easily identify good 
        apps, frameworks, and packages. Ever want to know which is the most popular or well supported Django 
        blog, content management system, or api tool? Django Packages solves that problem for you!
    </p>
    
    <h2>What is a Django package?</h2>
    
    <p>A Django package is anything that is involved in the Django ecosphere that can be stored on a 
        repository such as Github or Bitbucket. If it can be stored in <a href="http://pypi.org">PyPI</a>,
        that's even better!

        Since then we've been feverishly adding more features, improving the design, and trying to make data entry
         as easy/intuitive as possible.
