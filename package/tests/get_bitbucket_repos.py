"""
A script to find Bitbucket repos that (a) still exist and (b) have forks.

Usage:  python get_bitbucket_repos.py

Outputs a list of repos and the number of forks each has.

When testing repo handlers, the tests call the Bitbucket repo handler to
fetch repo metadata. However, many Bitbucket repos are no longer active,
have disappeared, or have no forks. This script was created to find a good
repo to test against, and, may be needed in the future if that particular
repo goes away. It may take a few minutes to run, due to only being able
to hit the APIs so fast.
