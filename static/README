This directory is used to store static assets for your project. User media files
(FileFields/ImageFields) are not stored here.

The convention for this directory is:

 * css/ — stores CSS files
 * js/ — stores Javascript files
 * img/ — stores image files
 
This directory is accessed at /site_media/static/ in runserver when SERVE_MEDIA
is True. It is built with build_static for production environments.

See http://pinaxproject.com/docs/dev/media.html for more information.
