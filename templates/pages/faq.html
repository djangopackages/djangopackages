                <h3>Who maintains this project?</h3>

                <p>The majority of hosting and development is provided by 
                    <a href="https://www.roygreenfeld.com/collections/two-scoops-press">Two Scoops Press</a>, an imprint of <a href="https://www.roygreenfeld.com/">Roy Greenfeld</a>.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    The code base maintenance is led by <a href="http://daniel.roygreenfeld.com">Daniel Roy Greenfeld</a> & <a href="https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>What role does the DSF have in this project?</h3>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a>
                    funded Django Packages development inn late 2017/early 2018.
                </p>

                <h3>What are grids?</h3>

                <p><a href="/grids/">Grids</a> let you compare {{ FRAMEWORK_TITLE }} packages to each other. A grid
                    comes with a number of default items compared,
                    but you can add more features in order to get a more specific comparison.</p>

                <p>For now, we are trying out {{ SITE_TITLE }} without the traditional tagging system, because we think
                    that
                    grids give us a lot more specificity.
                </p>

                <h3>What are categories?</h3>

                <p>Categories are broad groups of {{ FRAMEWORK_TITLE }} packages into something more granular than
                    Grids. A package can only have one category. Changing then requires backend work, and is not done
                    lightly. This is intentional, done in order to make searching easier.</p>

                <h3>Which source control sites do you support?</h3>

                <p>Github and Bitbucket are supported.</p>

                <h3>What about RSS & Atom Syndication?</h3>

                <p>The <a href="{% url 'syndication' %}">Syndication page</a> has more details.</p>

                <h3>How can I contribute?</h3>

                <p>This is an open source project, and we appreciate <a href="http://djangopackagesorg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html">all sorts of
                    contributions</a>.</p>
