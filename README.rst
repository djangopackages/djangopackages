For Django Dash 2010, @pydanny and @audreyr (the "Scared of Rabbits" team) created Django Packages and have been working on it since then, turning it into the OpenComparison framework. 

They are joined by a host of core developers and contributors.  See https://github.com/opencomparison/opencomparison/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.txt
