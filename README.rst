Introduction
=============

Open Comparison solves the problem in the Python community of being able to easily identify and compare good apps, frameworks, and packages. Ever want to know which is the most popular or well supported Python httplib replacement, web framework, or api tool? Open Comparison solves that problem for you! 

It does this by storing information on packages fetched from public APIs provided by PyPI, Github, BitBucket, Launchpad, and SourceForge, and then provides extremely useful comparison tools for them.

For Django Dash 2010, @pydanny and @audreyr (the "Scared of Rabbits" team) created Django Packages and have been working on it since then, turning it into the Open Comparison framework. They are joined by a host of core developers and contributors.
