Ever want to know which is the most popular or well supported Python httplib replacement, web framework, or api tool? Django Packages solves that problem for you! Django Packages allows you to easily identify good apps, frameworks, and packages.

Django Packages stores information on fetched packages and provides easy comparison tools for them. Public APIs include PyPI, Github, and BitBucket.

Grids!
~~~~~~

Grids let you compare packages. A grid comes with default comparison items and you can add features to get a more specific. We think comparison grids are an improvement over traditional tagging system because specificity helps make informed decisions.

Categories of Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fixtures provide four categories: apps, frameworks, projects, and utilities.

Not yet!

Django Packages was cooked up during Django Dash 2010. We wanted to keep the scope of our work reasonable. We'll try to include more sites in the future. Here are some details:

 * Sourceforge needs needs to repair their API and then we can play.
 * Google's lack of a formal API leaves us the option of screen-scraping their content. We're not using scraping in Django Packages.
