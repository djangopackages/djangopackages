# Welcome to Django Packagesâ€™ Documentation!

Django Packages solves the problem in the programming community of being able to easily identify good apps, frameworks, and packages. Ever want to know which is the most popular or well supported Python httplib replacement, web framework, or API tool? Django Packages solves that problem for you!

Django Packages stores information on packages fetched from public APIs provided by PyPI, GitHub, and BitBucket, then provides extremely useful comparison tools for them.

# The Story

Django Packages was established by Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfeld in 2010 during the Django Dash event. At the same event, the Read the Docs project was also created. Over the years, the project has benefitted from the contributions of several individuals and has undergone substantial growth and evolution through the efforts of both open-source contributors and dedicated maintainers.
