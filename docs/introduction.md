# Introduction

Have you ever had trouble figuring out which Django package is the best one for a particular purpose? 
Django Packages solves that problem for you!

Django Packages is a directory of Django apps, utilities, frameworks, and packages.

Django Packages stores information on fetched packages and provides easy comparison tools for them. 
Public APIs include PyPI, GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab.
