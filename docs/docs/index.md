# Welcome to Django Packages’ Documentation

[Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org/) is a website that helps Django developers choose the right third-party package to use in their Django project. It is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

The documentation is geared toward contributors and maintainers of Django Packages.

## About Django Packages

Django Packages contains information about more than 5,000 packages that can be used by Django developers to make their lives easier. Many types of packages can be added to Django Packages, including:

- **Apps**: Small components installed via `INSTALLED_APPS`
- **Frameworks**: Larger projects that combine many apps. Wagtail CMS, for example.
- **Projects**: Standalone projects that are not installed into your project, but may still be useful. The [djangoproject.com](https://www.djangoproject.com/) website, for example.
- **Other utilities**: Other packages that may or may not be installed, or are not directly relevant to Django-specific development, but are still useful to Django developers. The linter `black`, for example.

Django Packages makes it easier to compare packages to one another using **grids**. A **grid** is a collection of packages about a single topic. There is a grid for [CMS packages](https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/cms/), for example.

## Supported Platforms

- Bitbucket (some support)
