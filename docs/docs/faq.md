# FAQ

## General

### How did Django Packages get started?

- In 2010 We realized there was no effective method for finding apps in the Django community.
- After launch we realized it might be good to use the same software system for other package sets.

### Are there any Case Studies?

### How can I contribute?

Read the page on [contributions].

### How can I add a listing for a new Package or an entirely new Grid?

- Go the Home page, <https://www.djangopackages.org/>
- Click the appropriate button, where a package is a program and a grid is a category.

### What browsers does Django Packages support?

We do formal tests on Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

### How hard is it to add support for a new repo?

We've done a lot of work to make it as straightforward as possible. At PyCon 2011 we launched our formal [Repo Handler API].

## Supported Repo Hosting Services

Django Packages supports GitHub and Bitbucket.
