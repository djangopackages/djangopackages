Foreword
========

As of beginning 2016 the docker toolset is not quite there to provide a heroku like experience
when deploying to production. A lot of parts are already there, but have a few quirks that need
to be addressed.

Because of that, the deployment strategy for djangopackages.org is a bit different from what you
read in the getting started with docker tutorials.

First, we don't use docker-machine. It's not reliable and has no team of maintainers comparable
to other distros like debian, ubuntu or rhel that manages security releases.

Second, there's no way do daemonize the docker compose process. When the underlying VM is
restarded, the stack won't start automatically.

The current strategy is:

 - Use a virtual machine with a well patched OS (debian, ubuntu, RHEL), djangopackages.org is using
   ubuntu 14.04
 - Install docker, docker-compose, git and supervisord
 - Clone the code on the server
 - Let supervisord run it

Stack
=====

The configuration in `docker-compose.yml` contains 4 services:

 - `postgres` that powers the database
 - `django-a` and `django-b` that runs the WSGI server and serves the app through gunicorn
 - `caddy` that proxies incoming requests to the gunicorn server
 - `redis` as cache

Server Provisioning
===================

There's a bootstrap script available, run::

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydanny/djangopackages/master/server_bootstrap.sh

This will install docker, docker-compose on ubuntu 14.04.

Backups
=======

To create a backup, run::

    docker-compose run postgres backup


To list backups, run::

    docker-compose run postgres list-backups


To restore a backup, run::

    docker-compose run postgres restore filename.sql


Backups are located at `/data/djangopackages/backups` as plain SQL files.

When Things Go Wrong
====================

- Is docker running?::

    service docker status


- Is supervisor and both daemonized processes running?::

    supervisorctl status

- Are all services running?::

    cd /code/djangopackages
    docker-compose ps

- Check the logs for all services::

    cd /code/djangopackages
    docker-compose logs

- Check the logs for individual services::

    cd /code/djangopackages
    docker-compose logs postgres|django-a|django-b|caddy
