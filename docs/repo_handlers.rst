Repo Handler API
================

Adding a new repo in Packaginator is a relatively straightforward task. You need to provide two things:

#. Add a new repo handler in the apps.models.repos directory that follows the described API
#. Add tests to check your work
#. Document any special settings.
#. Change the SUPPORTED_REPO to include the name of the new repo handler.

What if my target repo doesn't support all the necessary fields?
================================================================

Lets say you want to use *GitBlarg*, a new service whose API doesn't provide the number of repo_watchers or participants. In order to handle them you would just set those values until such a time as *GitBlarg* would support the right data.

For example, as you can see in the `apps.models.repos.base_handler.BaseHandler.fetch_metadata()` method, the Package instance that it expects to see is a comma-seperated value::

    def fetch_metadata(self, package):
        """ Accepts a package.models.Package instance:
        
                return: package.models.Package instance
            
            Must set the following fields:

                package.repo_watchers (int)
                package.repo_forks (int)
                package.repo_description (text )
                package.participants = (comma-seperated value)

        """
        raise NotImplemented()

So your code might do the following::

    from GitBlargLib import GitBlargAPI
    def fetch_metadata(self, package):
    
        # fetch the GitBlarg data
        git_blarg_data = GitBlargAPI.get(package.repo_name())
        
        # set the package attributes
        package.repo_watchers = 0 # GitBlagAPI doesn't have this so we set to 0
        package.repo_forks = git_blarg_data.forks
        package.repo_description = git_blarg_data.note
        package.participants = u"" # GitBlagAPI doesn't have this so we set to an empty string
        
        return package

How about cloning GitBlarg's repos so we can get a better view of the data?
===========================================================================

The problem is that developers, designers, and managers will happily put gigabytes of data into a git/hg/svn/fossil/cvs repo. For a single project that doesn't sound like much, but when you are dealing with thousands of packages in a Packaginator instance the scale of the data becomes... well... terrifying. What is now a mild annoyance becomes a staggeringly large problem.

Therefore, pull requests on repo handlers that attempt to solve the problem this way will be summarily **rejected**.
